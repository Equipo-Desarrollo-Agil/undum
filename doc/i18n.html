<p>Undum provides support for translations and internationalization.
In particular, if you feel you want to translate Undum, then a lot
of work has already been done for you. I am very grateful to Oreolek
for this assistance. He translated the Russian version within days
of the code being released, and advised on the tools that would
make translation easier.</p>
<p>To write a game in another language, you need only to write the game
content in that language. The identifiers you use in the game (to
represent situations, actions, qualities and quality groups) must use
only unaccented lower case latin letters and numbers, but the text you
generate can contain any content you choose. Including right to left
content or ideographs.</p>
<p>Undum itself has a small number of error messages and pieces of text
that it uses. These include the default names for the
FudgeAdjectivesQuality values. These strings are all found at the end
of the <code>undum.js</code> file. They can be overridden. Simply define a new
language file for your language (e.g. <code>lang/gk.js</code>) and override the
appropriate strings. In your HTML file, after importing <code>undum.js</code>,
import you strings file. For example, the end of the Russian
translation of the tutorial (<code>tutorial.ru.html</code>) has:</p>
<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="media/js/undum.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="media/js/lang/ru.js"></script>
</code></pre>
<p>These translation strings are given as an object mapping the string
name to the translated strings. This object is given as part of the
<code>undum.translation</code> object, with a property name equal to the language
name. So, for example, the UK English translation might begin:</p>
<pre><code>undum.lanuage["en-UK"] = {
    no_group_definition: "Couldn't find a group definition for {id}.",
</code></pre>
<p>Within the translation strings, data to be incorporated later is given
in curly braces.</p>
<h2 id="h_1">Language Codes</h2>
<p>Undum uses a simplified version of the IETF standards for language
code. For our purposes this consists of three parts, only the first of
which is required: <code>language-Script-REGION</code> where <code>language</code> is a two
letter lower-case ISO language code, <code>Script</code> is a four letter
title-case script identifier, and <code>REGION</code> is a two letter country or
region code, all capitalized. The script is omitted when it is the
default script for a language and locale. You would specify a script
if you were using romaji (Latin letters) to write Japanese, but not if
you were writing it in Kanji and kana.</p>
<p>The major virtue of this standard is that it allows fall through when
a translation is not available. For example a translation into
Brazillian Portuguese <code>pt-BR</code> might be different to one into Angolan
Portuguese <code>pt-AO</code>, but there may be some strings they have in
common. This allows a translator to create a base file for just plain
Portuguese <code>pt</code>, then each country's dialect can define its own file
that just overrides a few of the strings.</p>
<div class="header"><div class="top"><a href="#title" title="Return to top">&#x25b2;</a></div><h2 id="h_2">Filename Conventions</h2></div>
<p>It is only a convention, but for all files that occur in language
specific versions, I have used the filename convention of placing the
language code before the extension, e.g. <code>filename.lang.extension</code>. The
game file is similar <code>filename.game.lang.js</code>. You are free to use any
format you choose, of course, but if you want to contribute back to
the trunk, please follow this convention, to save having to rename
things and connect up the links later.</p>
<div class="header"><div class="top"><a href="#title" title="Return to top">&#x25b2;</a></div><h2 id="h_3">API</h2></div>
<p>The translation system provides a simple API based on the <code>Globalite</code>
package of Nicolas Merouze (the implementation is unique to Undum). It
adds a <code>l()</code> method to the Javascript <code>String</code> prototype. This method
has the signature <code>l(data)</code>, where data can be any object mapping
strings to other strings.</p>
<p>The method attempts to figure out what the current language is by
looking at the <code>lang</code> attribute of the top level HTML tag (you'll
notice in the tutorial games this is defined in all cases, you should
do the same). It then tries to find a matching object containing
translations in <code>undum.language</code>. If it finds such an object, then it
looks up the original string in that object to find a translation. It
then merges any data passed into the <code>l</code> method into the string,
before returning the result.</p>
<p>The translation look-up honors the IETF rules for language fallback,
so (continuing the previous example) if your game file is in Brazilian
Portuguese <code>pt-BR</code>, and a translation isn't found, then generic
Portuguese translation <code>pt</code> is also checked. Finally, if no valid
translation is found, then the default version is used. Since Undum
was written in English, this default version is the English
version. This is purely by my convenience, and isn't part of the IETF
spec!</p>
